<h1>The Best Movies According to Tom</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy 1&2</h3>
<p>These movies are great, and the sound track is awesome.</p>
<h3>Blood Diamond</h3>
<p>Great movie, thats all I can say. Very dramatic and tough.</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>Once again I love the Marvel movies to this point and they put
    a big twist in the franchise with the villian winning and ending
    the movie there.
